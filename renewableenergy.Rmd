---------------------------------

Traditional energy sources like coal, oil and natural gas, have contributed to high levels of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.

One potential way of removing the impact of greenhouse gas emission is mitigation â€“ that is, activities intended to reduce the magnitude of climate change and its impact on human life. 

The shift to cleaner forms of energy production through the adoption of renewable energy sources is a key mitigation strategy for countries like India and China. 

What about the European countries? Are they also shifting their energy sources to renewable ones? What do explain the adoption of renewable energy in European countries?
